/*

STL(Standard Template Library --> it is predefines libraries which is used for saving the processing powers and optimizing the code complexity and improve the code readably


Components of STL:

1. Containers --> store the data using the templates
2. Algorithms --> sorting, searching
3. Iterators --> it is a object that points the object in the containers (like pointers )


STL = containers(object which store the data ) + Algorithms(procedure to process the data) + Iterators(object which points to an element of a containers )


Containers--> it is 3 types of :
        1. Sequence Containers --> store the data in linear fashion.
                1.1 vector--> random access-->Fast, insertion/deletion-->slow
                1.2 list--> random access-->slow, insertion/deletion-->Fast, 
                1.3 double ended queue

        2. Associative Containers --> direct access ( set, map, multiset, multimap, tree structure like storage )
                --> all the operations are fast Except Random Access

        3. Derived Containers --> real world Modeling ( queue, stack, priority queue )
                --> Depends on the Data Structure
